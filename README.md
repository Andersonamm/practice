# Practice
This is a public repository that allows you to exercise your git knowledge.

In order to improve your git knowledge, you should execute all steps in the git simulator available in http://try.github.io.

Once you finishes all steps executed inside the simulator, now its time to go to real world :) than execute the same steps on this git repository.

I really expect that lot of problems and when this happening, we will have a lot of fun solving then together.
